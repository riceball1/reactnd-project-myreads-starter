# React Nanodegree: Project 1 - MyReads


## Starting App:
- Regular startup without production version:
    - `npm start`
    - Check `localhost:3000`

Other Issues:
- Currently the production version doesn't produce the correct output:
    - `npm install -g serve`
    - `serve -s build`
    - Check `localhost:5000`
